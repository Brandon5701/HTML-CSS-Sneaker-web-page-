<h1>SneakerPlug.NYC</h1>
<p><strong>-Store Brand:</strong>SneakerPlug.NYC</p>
<br>
<p><strong>-Description:</strong>A fashion-based sneaker store that sells
  the most popular name brand sneakers for retail prices with limited stock on each shoe.
  Each shoe will sell out in seconds online and when the sneaker store is put in a local
  area will be a huge line with raffles each time a big release drops. Brands such and Nike,
  Adidas, Jordan, and others will be sold. Collab releases with off-white, Palm, Angles, Fear
  of God, Kaws, Commes Des Garcon, Bape and many more.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>-purpose:</strong> I am interested in this brand because it will bring more job
  to the community with selling products that will always be in demand. two to three stores
  located on local areas of Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan along with was a website
  will bring more than enough revenue and job opportunities to the community. In the
  future the brand will expand others places outside NYC such as Seattle, Los Angeles,
  Atlanta, Florida, and Washington D.C. The stores will have merchandise other than
  sneakers. Donations and food pantry will be held twice at the store to uplift the
  community. 2 percent of profit will be donated to the red cross and 3 percent will
  be donated to covid relief. Investing & funding SneakerPlug.NYC  is a great choice
  because its an attraction that people cannot  resist.  Fashion sneakers are like the
  stocks because something is always on the rise. People love fashion and will do
  anything for it because it has the potential to bring different people together to
  celebrate their own individuality. Most people are attracted to fashion that is hard
  to find along with not easy to buy. In modern society we put fashion on a higher scale
  than its ever been. Some people find fashion as a better a better way to express their
  personality and SneakerPlug.NYC supports and understands. The goal is to bring positivity
   & income to the community after a chaotic year Due to Covid-19. </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Store will be closed 3/25 & will be held as a center
   for a blood drive to donate to the Red Cross and Covid-19 relief</li>
